# Overview
The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with the language of C++ by creating a tutorial that covers the basic concepts and principles of the language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
During this project I used the C++ programming language in the Visual Studio Code IDE. I only used the standard libraries of the language.

# Useful Websites

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
- [Official C++ Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/?view=msvc-170)

# Future Work

- Add a module that covers the most popular data structures from the standard C++ libraries
- Add a "challenge exercise" to each module that encourages the user to solve a problem by using what they've learned
